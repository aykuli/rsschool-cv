    https://github.com/aykuli    
3. I like coding. It's appropriate extend from my love to mathematic. I was learning coding while being in parental leave.
4.  Languages: JavaScript vanilla, HTML, CSS, Python, assembler, C51 for Aduc microcontrollers.
    Version control: Git.
    Frameworks, methodoligies: Gulp, Sass, Pug, BEM.
    Tools: Visual Studio Code, Sublime. Phototshop.
5. Cash Register from FreeCodeCamp
Task: "Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.
cid is a 2D array listing available currency.
The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.
Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.
Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.
Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

Currency Unit	Amount
Penny	$0.01 (PENNY)
Nickel	$0.05 (NICKEL)
Dime	$0.1 (DIME)
Quarter	$0.25 (QUARTER)
Dollar	$1 (DOLLAR)
Five Dollars	$5 (FIVE)
Ten Dollars	$10 (TEN)
Twenty Dollars	$20 (TWENTY)
One-hundred Dollars	$100 (ONE HUNDRED)
"

Code:

var denom = [
  { name: 'ONE HUNDRED', val: 100 },
  { name: 'TWENTY', val: 20 },
  { name: 'TEN', val: 10 },
  { name: 'FIVE', val: 5 },
  { name: 'ONE', val: 1 },
  { name: 'QUARTER', val: 0.25 },
  { name: 'DIME', val: 0.1 },
  { name: 'NICKEL', val: 0.05 },
  { name: 'PENNY', val: 0.01 },
];

function checkCashRegister(price, cash, cid) {
  var output = { status: null, change: [] };
  var change = cash - price;
  var register = cid.reduce(
    function(acc, curr) {
      acc.total += curr[1];
      acc[curr[0]] = curr[1];
      return acc;
    }, { total: 0 });
    
  if (register.total === change) {
    output.status = 'CLOSED';
    output.change = cid;
    return output;
  }
  if (register.total < change) {
    output.status = 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS';
    return output;
  }
  var change_arr = denom.reduce(function(acc, curr) {
    var value = 0;
    while (register[curr.name] > 0 && change >= curr.val) {
      change -= curr.val;
      register[curr.name] -= curr.val;
      value += curr.val;
      change = Math.round(change * 100) / 100;
    }
    if (value > 0) {
      acc.push([curr.name, value]);
    }
    return acc;
  }, []);
  if (change_arr.length < 1 || change > 0) {
    output.status = 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS';
    return output;
  }
  output.status = 'OPEN';
  output.change = change_arr;
  return output;
}

checkCashRegister(19.5, 20, [
  ['PENNY', 1.01],
  ['NICKEL', 2.05],
  ['DIME', 3.1],

6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
